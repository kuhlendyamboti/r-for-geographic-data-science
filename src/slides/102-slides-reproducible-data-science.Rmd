## Data science

.pull-left[

The term *"data science"* has gained wide-spread usage in the past decade

- akin **data mining**
- including or bordering
    - machine learning
    - artificial intelligence
    - statistical analysis
    - data visualisation
- commonly associated with
    - **big data**
    - the use of **programming**
        - python and R in particular
        - but not necessarily
    - **interdisciplinarity**
        - generally used for those who *use* those tools within an *application field* (e.g., geography or geology)

## Reproduciblity

.pull-left[
In quantitative research, an analysis or project are considered to be **reproducible** if:

- *"the data and code used to make a finding are available and they are sufficient for an independent researcher to recreate the finding."* [Christopher Gandrud, *Reproducible Research with R and R Studio*](https://www.crcpress.com/Reproducible-Research-with-R-and-R-Studio/Gandrud/p/book/9781498715379)

That is becoming more and more important in science:

- as programming and scripting are becoming integral in most disciplines
- as the amount of data increases

]
.pull-right[

In **scientific research**:

- verificability of claims through replication
- incremental work, avoid duplication

For your **working practice**:

- better working practices
    - coding
    - project structure
    - versioning
- better teamwork
- higher impact (not just results, but code, data, etc.)

## Reproducibility in GIScience

[Singleton *et al.*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13658816.2015.1137579) have discussed the issue of reproducibility in GIScience, identifying the following best practices:

1. Data should
    - be accessible within the public domain
    - available to researchers
2. Software used should 
    - have open code
    - be scrutable
3. Workflows should 
    - be public
    - link data, software, methods of analysis and presentation with discursive narrative
4. The peer review process and academic publishing should 
    - require submission of a workflow model
    - ideally open archiving of those materials necessary for replication
5. Where full reproducibility is not possible (commercial software or sensitive data) 
    - aim to adopt aspects attainable within circumstances


---

## Reproducibility and software engineering

.pull-left[

Emergence of **"big data"**

- volume, velocity, variety, ...

Beyond the hype of the moment, as the **amount** and **complexity** of data increases

- the time required to replicate an analysis using point-and-click software becomes unsustainable
- room for error increases

Two options:

- Workflow management software (e.g., ArcGIS ModelBuilder) 
- Reproducible data analysis (based on script languages like R)


]
.pull-right[

Core aspects of **software engineering** are:

- project design
- software **readibility**
- testing
- **versioning**

As programming becomes integral to research, similar necessities arise among scientists and data analysts.

5 key aspects identified by [Gandrud](https://www.crcpress.com/Reproducible-Research-with-R-and-R-Studio/Gandrud/p/book/9781498715379)

- Document everything
- Document well
- Workflow
- Future-proof formats
- Store and share

]

.pull-left[

## Document everything

In order to be reproducible, every step of your project should be documented in detail

- data gathering
- data analysis
- results presentation

Well documented R scripts are an excellent way to document your project. 

]
.pull-right[

## Document well

Create code that can be **easily understood** by someone outside your project, including yourself in six-month time!

- use a style guide (e.g. [tidyverse](http://style.tidyverse.org/)) consistently
- also add a **comment** before any line that could be ambiguous or particularly difficult or important
- add a **comment** before each code block, describing what the code does
- add a **comment** at the beginning of a file, including
    - date
    - contributors
    - other files the current file depends on
    - materials, sources and other references 

]


---

## Workflow

Relationships between files in a project are not simple:

- in which order are file executed?
- when to copy files from one folder to another, and where?

A common solution is using **make files**

- commonly written in *bash* on Linux systems
- they can be written in R, using commands like
    - *source* to execute R scripts
    - *system* to interact with the operative system

Example: section of the [*R for Geographic Data Science*](https://github.com/sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science) project's make file [Make.R](https://github.com/sdesabbata/r-for-geographic-data-science/blob/main/src/Make.R)

```{}
cat("\n\n>>> Rendering 102-slides-reproducible-data-science.Rmd <<<\n\n")
rmarkdown::render(
  paste0(Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), "/src/slides/102-slides-reproducible-data-science.Rmd"), 
  quiet = TRUE, 
  output_dir = paste0(Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), "/docs/slides")
)

```

.pull-left[

## Future-proof formats

Complex formats (e.g., .docx, .xlsx, .shp, ArcGIS .mxd)

- can become obsolete
- are not always portable
- usually require proprietary software

Use the simplest format to **future-proof** your analysis.<br/>**Text files** are the most versatile

- data: .txt, .csv, .tsv
- analysis: R scripts, python scripts
- write-up: LaTeX, Markdown, HTML


]
.pull-right[

## Store and share

Reproducible data analysis is particularly important when working in teams, to share and communicate your work.

- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)
    - good option to work in teams, initially free
    - no versioning, branches
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
    - free and opensource control system
    - great to work in teams and share your work publicly
    - can be more difficult at first
    - [GitHub](https://github.com) offers free public and private repositories
    - [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) offers free public and private repositories

## Text file formats

<br/>

.pull-left[

[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) includes or [imports](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/#import) many libraries for reading data

- Tabular formats
  - [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) for plain text
  - [`readxl`](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/) for Excel (`.xls` and `.xlsx`)
  - [`haven`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) for SPSS, Stata, and SAS data.
- Databases
  - [`DBI`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/) for relational databases
- NoSQL
  - [`jsonlite`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/) for JSON
  - [`xml2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xml2/) for XML
- Web
  - [`httr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/) for web APIs

]
.pull-right[

A wide range of formats based on plain-text files exist to represent tabular data

For instance

- tabular formats
    - comma-separated values files `.csv`
    - semi-colon-separated values files `.csv`
    - tab-separated values files `.tsv`
    - other formats using custom delimiters
    - fix-width files `.fwf`

## Output Area Classification

.pull-left[

The file `2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv` contains

- one row for each [Output Area (OA)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography) in Leicester
- [Lower-Super Output Area (LSOA)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/ukgeographies/censusgeography) containing the OA
- code and name of the supergroup assigned to the OA by the [2011 Output Area Classification](http://geogale.github.io/2011OAC/)
- total population of the OA

Extract showing only the first few rows

```{}
OA11CD,LSOA11CD,supgrpcode,supgrpname,Total_Population
E00069517,E01013785,6,Suburbanites,313
E00069514,E01013784,2,Cosmopolitans,323
E00169516,E01013713,4,Multicultural Metropolitans,341
E00169048,E01032862,4,Multicultural Metropolitans,345

## readr

.pull-left[

The [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) (pronounced *read-er*) provides functions to read and write text files

- `readr::read_csv`: comma-separated files `.csv`
- `readr::read_csv2`: semi-colon-separated files `.csv`
- `readr::read_tsv`: tab-separated files `.tsv`
- `readr::read_fwf`: fix-width files `.fwf`
- `readr::read_delim`: files using a custom delimiter

and their *write* counterpart, such as

- `readr::write_csv`: comma-separated files `.csv`

]
.pull-right[


Read functions provide options about how to interpret a file contents

- For instance, `readr::read_csv`
  - `col_names`: 
    - `TRUE` or `FALSE` whether top row is column names
    - or a vector of column names
  - `col_types`:
    - a `cols()` specification or a string
  - `skip`: lines to skip before reading data
  - `n_max`: max number of record to read

]

---

## readr::read_csv

The `readr::read_csv` function of the [`readr`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/index.html) library reads a *csv* file from the path provided as the first argument

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

leicester_2011OAC <- 
  read_csv("2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv")

leicester_2011OAC
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
leicester_2011OAC <- read_csv(paste0(Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), "/data/", "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv"))
leicester_2011OAC %>% 
  print()
```


---

## readr::read_csv

.pull-left[

Using `readr::read_csv` as in the previous example with no further options 

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
leicester_2011OAC <- 
  read_csv("2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv")

leicester_2011OAC
```

will generate the following warning

```{}
Parsed with column specification:
cols(
  OA11CD = col_character(),
  LSOA11CD = col_character(),
  supgrpcode = col_double(),
  supgrpname = col_character(),
  Total_Population = col_double()
)
```


]
.pull-right[

See [`readr` column specification](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/cols.html)

- `col_logical()` or `l` as logic values
- `col_integer()` or `i` as integer
- `col_double()` or `d` as numeric (double)
- `col_character()` or `c` as character
- `col_factor(levels, ordered)` or `f` as factor
- `col_date(format = "")` or `D` as data type
- `col_time(format = "")` or `t` as time type
- `col_datetime(format = "")` or `T` as datetime
- `col_number()` or `n` as numeric (dropping marks)
- `col_skip()` or `_` or `-` don’t import
- `col_guess()` or `?` use best type based on the input

]



---

## readr::read_csv

Alternatively, column specifications can be provided manually

- using the argument `col_types`
- and the function `cols`

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
leicester_2011OAC <- read_csv(
    "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv",
    col_types = cols(
      OA11CD  = col_character(),
      LSOA11CD  = col_character(),
      supgrpcode  = col_character(),
      supgrpname  = col_character(),
      Total_Population  = col_integer()
    )
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
leicester_2011OAC <- read_csv(
    paste0(Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), "/data/", "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv"),
    col_types = cols(
      OA11CD  = col_character(),
      LSOA11CD  = col_character(),
      supgrpcode  = col_character(),
      supgrpname  = col_character(),
      Total_Population  = col_integer()
    )
  ) 

leicester_2011OAC%>% 
  print(n= 5)
```


---

## readr::read_csv


Alternatively, column specifications can be provided manually

- using the argument `col_types`
- and the corresponding one-letter codes for each column

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
leicester_2011OAC <- read_csv(
    "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv",
    col_types = "cccci"
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
leicester_2011OAC <- read_csv(
    paste0(Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), "/data/", "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv"),
    col_types = "cccci"
  ) 

leicester_2011OAC%>% 
  print()
```


---

## readr::write_csv

.pull-left[

The function `write_csv` can be used to save a dataset to `csv`

Example:

1. `read` the 2011 OAC dataset
2. `select` a few columns
3. `filter` only those OA in the supergroup *Suburbanites* (code `6`)
4. `write` the results to a file named *2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester_supgrp6.csv*

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
read_csv("2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv") %>%
  select(
    OA11CD, supgrpcode, Total_Population
  ) %>%
  filter(supgrpcode == "6") %>%
  write_csv(
    "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester_supgrp6.csv"
  )
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
read_csv(
    paste0(Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), "/data/", "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv")
  ) %>%
  select(OA11CD, supgrpcode, Total_Population) %>%
  filter(supgrpcode == "6") %>%
  write_csv(
    paste0(Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), "/data/", "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester_supgrp6.csv")
  )
```

.referencenote[
(... more on `select` and `filter` next week)
]

]
.pull-right[

Alternatively, `write_tsv` can be used

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
read_csv("2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv") %>%
  select(
    OA11CD, supgrpcode, Total_Population
  ) %>%
  filter(supgrpcode == "6") %>%
  write_tsv(
    "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester_supgrp6.tsv"
  )
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
read_csv(
    paste0(Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), "/data/", "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester.csv")
  ) %>%
  select(OA11CD, supgrpcode, Total_Population) %>%
  filter(supgrpcode == "6") %>%
  write_tsv(
    paste0(Sys.getenv("RGDS_HOME"), "/data/", "2011_OAC_supgrp_Leicester_supgrp6.tsv")
  )
```

```{}
OA11CD      supgrpcode  Total_Population
